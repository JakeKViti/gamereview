## Usage

When the website opens you will get 3 options, Sign-up, Login, or Login with Facebook. Signup will let you register with a email, username and password. Then take you to login.

Once you login, you will be at the user's show page. The User show page will show your name, email, and all the reviews the user has created. In the top right, you can go to Games index, Reviews Index, or go back to User Show. These will persist through the entire site.

The Games page will show every game created on the site. The Admin will add and edit the games if there are errors or if they need to add more. Clicking on a game will show all the reviews for that game, the ability to create a review for that game, and see information on that game.

The Review page will show the last 5 most recent review and a link to create a new review. In the new review, you will have to enter a title for your review, your thoughts, and a rating from 0 to 100.
